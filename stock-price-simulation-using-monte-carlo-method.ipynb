One way to address this challenge is to simulate the price movement using [Monte Carlo method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method).\n\nBriefly speaking, Monte Carlo method assumes that a certain phenomenon (price movement) is deterministic and that we know its probability distribution and hence we can simulate it. These assumptions are naive. Therefore, an analyst should be careful with interpretation of the result.\n\nLet us begin our analysis. First, we will decide on what data we will work on and download it. Second, we will design our model based on [Geometric Brownian Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion) and set key model parameters. Finally, we will run our simulation and plot the result.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import math\nimport random\nimport io\nimport requests\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom scipy import stats\nfrom dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta","metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We will model the stock price of Apple for the next year using 1000 simulations.\n\nIn determining model parameters (expected annual return and expected annual volatility) we will use data from the last 5 years.
